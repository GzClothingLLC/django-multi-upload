# django-multi-upload

The video tutorial with explanation is on this link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9MDtQHwGYM

The media folder contains three dummy files which I used for the tutorial.

The db.sqlite3 doesn't really contain anything because I didn't make use of any models for the upload function. But you can use it on the Upload view if you want by editing it appropriately.

If you have any kind of questions please feel free to email me at: hasan.mohaiminul@gmail.com
